# air — Architecture, Decisions, and Roadmap

**Version:** 1.8.0 <!-- x-release-please-version -->

---

## What It Is

**air** is an automated code review system with two distribution paths:

1. **CLI Plugin** — runs locally in Claude Code, triggered manually with `/air:review`
2. **Managed Agent** — runs in Anthropic's cloud, triggered automatically by GitHub Actions on every PR

Both paths use the same 5 agent prompts, same wiki patterns, same review format, and learn from each other.

## What's Shared vs Separate

| Component | CLI Plugin | Managed Agent | Shared? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent prompts (5 files) | Loaded as subagent_type | Read by setup.py → API agents | **YES — single source** |
| Wiki patterns (6 files) | git clone/push locally | git clone/push from sandbox | **YES — same wiki** |
| Review output format | Defined in review.md | Templated in review.py verifier prompt | Equivalent — same markdown shape |
| Orchestrator logic | review.md (markdown → Claude Code) | review.py (Python → asyncio.gather) | Implementation-specific by design |
| Learn logic | learn.md | learn-orchestrator.md | NO — duplicated (single-agent flow, not fanned out) |
| Auth | User's local gh auth | Bot PAT via github_repository resource | Different |
| Trigger | Manual: /air:review | Automatic: GitHub Action on PR | Different |
| Modes | --self, --respond (+ --dry-run), --full, --re-review, --fresh, --rewrite, --closed, --dry-run | auto, fresh, re-review, closed | CLI has more |
| Respond self-check | Scales by diff size: < 50 lines = code-reviewer + verifier only | Same (in orchestrator) | YES — same logic |
| Cross-repo wiki | Reads TARGET repo's wiki (skip write only) | N/A | Changed in v1.4.0 |
| Codex (GPT-5.4) | Optional 5th reviewer | Not available | CLI only |
| GitLab | Supported via platform-gitlab.md | Not yet | CLI only |

## CLI Plugin Pipeline (13 steps)

```
/air:review [number] [flags]
  │
  ├── Step 1: Parse arguments (PR number, flags, cross-repo detection)
  ├── Step 2: Smart default (check existing reviews, auto re-review)
  ├── Step 3: Load context (CLAUDE.md, wiki patterns, project memory, session context)
  ├── Step 3.5: First-run project discovery (PROJECT-PROFILE.md + GLOSSARY.md + `.air-checks.sh` [v1.6.0+])
  ├── Step 4: Fetch PR data (batched API, diff, commits, blame, churn, previous PR comments)
  ├── Step 5: Pre-flight checks (state, draft, CI, conflict markers, file complexity, pure-promotion detection)
  ├── Step 6: Re-review mode (inter-diff, developer responses, FIXED/NOT FIXED tracking)
  │
  ├── Step 7: Parallel review ← 5 reviewers launched simultaneously
  │   ├── Phase A: Codex (background, GPT-5.4)
  │   └── Phase B: 4 agents via Agent tool
  │       ├── code-reviewer (+ author pattern matching)
  │       ├── simplify (reuse, quality, efficiency)
  │       ├── security-auditor (31-item checklist + author patterns)
  │       └── git-history-reviewer (blame, churn + author patterns)
  │
  ├── Step 8: Verification (review-verifier filters false positives, bootstrap calibration defaults when no SEVERITY-CALIBRATION.md exists)
  ├── Step 9: Console attribution (severity table, drops/downgrades — never posted)
  ├── Step 10: Consolidate (deduplicate, strengths, wiki drift collection)
  ├── Step 11: Format (clickable links, sequential numbering, code blocks)
  ├── Step 12: Post (new comment or PATCH, own-PR guard, review verdict)
  └── Step 13: Learn (author pattern lifecycle, graduated resistance, wiki push)
```

**Additional modes (extracted into separate files):**
- `--self` / `--self --fix` — (`review-self.md`) review local changes, generate fix plan, optionally auto-apply. Never posts a PR comment; wiki patterns still push.
- `--respond` — (`review-respond.md`) auto-classify findings, self-check (scaled by diff size: < 50 lines uses code-reviewer + verifier only), post response. Supports `--dry-run`.
- `--full` — review entire codebase (all files, console only)

**Pre-commit drift check (v1.6.0+, CLI-only):** The plugin registers a `PreToolUse` hook on `Bash` via `hooks/hooks.json`. The wrapper at `hooks/pre-commit-drift.py` narrows to `git commit` calls (handles `git -C <path> commit`, respects `--no-verify`), locates the repo root, and runs either the repo's executable `.air-checks.sh` (custom rules) or `hooks/builtin-checks.sh` (zero-config auto-detection of manifest-version vs doc mirrors). Non-zero exit blocks the commit with output shown to Claude. Step 3.5 and `/air:learn` Step 4.65 generate/augment `.air-checks.sh` from the wiki's `PROJECT-PROFILE.md`. Custom scripts receive `$AIR_PLUGIN_ROOT` in env so they can delegate to built-ins.

## Managed Agent Pipeline (v1.7.0 — client-side orchestrator)

```
PR opened → GitHub Action → managed/review.py
  │
  ├── [1] Sync 5 specialist agents (setup.py: find by name → create or PATCH with latest prompts)
  ├── [2] Fetch PR metadata + diff from GitHub API (via AIR_BOT_TOKEN on the runner)
  ├── [3] Build PR Context block (Python)
  │
  ├── [4] asyncio.gather 4 specialist sessions in parallel:
  │     ├── air-code-reviewer       (own container, clones repo + wiki, returns findings)
  │     ├── air-simplify            (own container, same)
  │     ├── air-security-auditor    (own container, same)
  │     └── air-git-history-reviewer (own container, same)
  │
  ├── [5] Sequential verifier session (air-review-verifier receives all 4 findings sets,
  │       filters false positives, emits final review comment markdown)
  │
  └── [6] Python posts the review comment directly via GitHub API (no 6th session)
```

The orchestrator is the **Python driver**, not a server-side agent. Anthropic's `callable_agents` (server-side parallel sub-agents) is gated behind a Managed Agents multiagent Research Preview, so we fan out client-side. Each specialist session spawns its own container for tool execution — same as the CLI plugin's `Agent`-tool fan-out, just one container per specialist instead of one Claude Code process with parallel subagents.

---

## Agent Prompts (Shared, Single Source of Truth)

**code-reviewer.md** — Bugs, logic errors, error handling, design, test coverage. Checks orphan imports on deleted files, reference updates on renames. Author pattern annotations are inline in the output format section (for EVERY finding, check against known patterns). Parameter sprawl and leaky abstractions under Design & Architecture.

**simplify.md** — Three sections:
- Code Reuse: active codebase search via Grep/Glob, reinvented utilities, missed shared modules
- Code Quality: dead code, copy-paste with variation, stringly-typed code, unnecessary comments, redundant state
- Efficiency: N+1 patterns, missed concurrency, hot-path bloat, TOCTOU, overly broad operations, no-op updates, unbounded structures

**security-auditor.md** — 31-item checklist:
- Sensitive data (6), injection (4), auth (3), input validation (3), data exposure (3), operational security (4), silent failures (5), resource exhaustion (3)
- PROJECT-PROFILE.md controls which checks apply per repo
- Author pattern annotations inline in output format (security-relevant patterns are high-signal)

**git-history-reviewer.md** — Blame analysis (stale code, absent authors, integration boundaries), churn patterns (5+ commits/6mo = design smell), previous PR review comments, author pattern matching.

**review-verifier.md** — Post-review quality gate. Reads actual source at flagged lines. 6 verdicts: CONFIRMED, DOWNGRADED, IMPROVEMENT, PRE-EXISTING, ACCEPTED PATTERN, FALSE POSITIVE. Confidence scoring (0-100), default threshold 60. SEVERITY-CALIBRATION.md overrides per-agent thresholds when sufficient data exists.

---

## Author Pattern Lifecycle

Patterns in REVIEW.md are behavioral profiles that evolve over time:

```
### alice
- **Shell injection risk** (3x: #45, #52, #67 | last 2 PRs: 2 clean): Misses escapeshellarg() on user input
- **Empty array guard** (1x: #67 | new): Uses implode() on arrays without checking empty first
```

Format: `**<Pattern name>** (<Nx>: <PR refs> | last <N> PRs: <M> clean): <Description>`

Lifecycle:
- **Create** — `(1x: #PR | new)` — generalize from specific incident to behavioral tendency
- **Strengthen** — increment count, add PR ref, reset clean counter to 0
- **Decline** — 5 consecutive clean PRs → append `(declining)`
- **Archive** — 10 consecutive clean PRs → move to `### <author> (archived)`
- **Never delete** — archived patterns stay permanently as historical context

3 of 4 review agents (code-reviewer, security-auditor, git-history-reviewer) annotate findings with `[matches author pattern: <name> (<Nx>)]`. The orchestrator uses annotations to drive lifecycle transitions in Step 13.

---

## Wiki Storage (6 pages per repo)

| Page | Purpose | Updated by |
|---|---|---|
| REVIEW.md | Curated patterns: common findings, author profiles, service gotchas | Every review (Step 13) + learn |
| REVIEW-HISTORY.md | Auto-generated analytics: finding frequency, file hot spots, author trends | Learn (KAIROS) |
| PROJECT-PROFILE.md | Project characteristics: languages, architecture, review focus rules, applicable security checks | First-run discovery + learn refresh |
| GLOSSARY.md | Domain terminology: prevents false findings on intentional naming | First-run + learn |
| ACCEPTED-PATTERNS.md | Team-approved patterns that suppress matching findings | Developer disputes (graduated resistance) |
| SEVERITY-CALIBRATION.md | Per-agent confidence thresholds from dispute rates | Learn (when 10+ data points) |

---

## Authentication (Managed Agent)

**Decision: Machine bot account with classic PAT**

- Bot account: `air-machine` (regular GitHub account used as bot)
- Classic PAT with `repo` scope (fine-grained PATs don't support wiki push or GraphQL comments)
- Token passed two ways:
  - `github_repository` resource: mounts repo with auth (clone/push, token in API request, not conversation)
  - `GH_TOKEN` in session message: for `gh` CLI (comments, review verdicts). Visible in Anthropic session logs — accepted tradeoff with minimal-permission bot account.

**Alternatives evaluated and rejected:**

| Option | Why rejected |
|---|---|
| GitHub App | Complex onboarding (private key, JWT, installation tokens) |
| Fine-grained PAT | Doesn't support wiki push or GraphQL comments |
| Vault + MCP OAuth | Read-only — can't write comments or push wiki |
| GITHUB_TOKEN | Free but can't push to wiki repos |
| Centralized token service | Requires hosting infrastructure |

---

## Agent Management

**Self-bootstrapping:** First PR on any org auto-creates agents. No manual setup.py needed.

**Find by name:** `GET /v1/agents` → Python driver looks up each of the 5 specialists (`air-code-reviewer`, `air-simplify`, `air-security-auditor`, `air-git-history-reviewer`, `air-review-verifier`) by name. No config files, no stored IDs. Each org's API key isolates their agents.

**Auto-update:** Every run calls setup.py which PATCHes each agent with the latest prompt from the air repo. Uses `version` field for optimistic concurrency. When you merge a prompt change to main, the next PR on any org picks it up automatically.

**Duplicates:** If race condition creates multiples, newest is used (dict overwrite on reversed API list). Harmless — clean up manually if needed.

**Agent inventory per org:**

| Agent | Model | Tools | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| air-code-reviewer | Opus | read, grep, glob, bash | Code quality review |
| air-simplify | Sonnet | read, grep, glob | Reuse, quality, efficiency (no bash) |
| air-security-auditor | Opus | read, grep, glob, bash | 31-item security audit |
| air-git-history-reviewer | Sonnet | read, grep, glob, bash | Blame, churn, history |
| air-review-verifier | Opus | read, grep, glob, bash | False-positive filtering + emits the final review comment markdown (v1.7.0+) |
| air-learner | Opus | all (agent_toolset) | Wiki maintenance |
| air-test | Sonnet | all (agent_toolset) | Quick 9-test verification |

**Note:** `air-reviewer` (server-side orchestrator) was removed in v1.7.0 — `managed/review.py` is now the orchestrator (client-side). Existing deployments can safely archive or leave the old `air-reviewer` agent — it's orphaned but harmless.

Model tiering introduced in v1.5.0: judgment-heavy reviewers stay on Opus, mechanical / pattern-matching reviewers (simplify, git-history-reviewer) run on Sonnet for ~5× cheaper input. Models are declared in each agent's frontmatter (`plugins/air/agents/<name>.md`) and resolved to API IDs via `managed/setup.py::MODEL_ALIASES`.

---

## Team Onboarding (per org)

| Step | Who | Time | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Org admin | 2 min | Create bot GitHub account |
| 2 | Org admin | 1 min | Add bot as collaborator (Write) to repos |
| 3 | Org admin | 2 min | Generate classic PAT (`repo` scope) on bot account |
| 4 | Org admin | 2 min | Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `AIR_BOT_TOKEN` as org secrets |
| 5 | Any dev | 1 min | Add workflow YAML to repo |

First PR auto-bootstraps. No setup scripts, no config files, no CLI installation required.

---

## Review Output Format

Both CLI and managed produce identical format:

```
## Code Review

<one-line summary>

### Security Audit: <pass>/<total> PASS

## Cost

| Component | Model | Per review | Monthly (40 reviews) |
|---|---|---|---|
| code-reviewer, security-auditor | Opus | ~$0.75 each | ~$60 combined |
| simplify, git-history-reviewer | Sonnet | ~$0.15 each | ~$12 combined |
| review-verifier | Opus | ~$0.50 | ~$20 |
| Managed Agent session overhead | — | ~$0.02 | ~$0.80 |
| **Total** | — | **~$2.30** | **~$90** |

v1.5.0 model tiering (simplify + git-history-reviewer → Sonnet) removes ~$1/review relative to all-Opus at current Opus 4.7 pricing.

---

## Known Limitations

**Managed Agent:**
- Parallel execution via client-side orchestration (v1.7.0+). 4 specialists run concurrently in separate sessions; wall-clock ≈ slowest specialist + verifier (~5-8 min).
- Server-side parallel sub-agents (`callable_agents`) remain unavailable — gated behind Anthropic's Managed Agents multiagent Research Preview. `managed/test-parallel.py` smoke-tests access; as of 2026-04-23 we do not have it.
- GH_TOKEN visible in Anthropic session logs (mitigated by bot account minimal permissions, rotatable).
- Wiki push can timeout in sandbox (5-min command limit). Mitigated with explicit token in wiki remote URL; each specialist session clones the wiki independently.
- No Codex (GPT-5.4) — CLI-only feature, requires OpenAI plugin.
- GitHub-only — no GitLab support yet.
- `github_repository` resource only clones the PR branch — base branch must be fetched separately (`git fetch origin main`).

**CLI Plugin:**
- review.md reduced to 879 lines (from 1276) — --self and --respond extracted to separate files. Still long; further extraction planned.
- Subagents CANNOT spawn other subagents (Claude Code hard limit, nesting depth = 1).
- Plugin auto-update unreliable — marketplace pulls repo but doesn't always re-install to cache.
- Auto-trigger for /air:learn sometimes skipped due to prompt length (mitigated with >>> markers and explicit RETURN in Step 13).

**Both:**
- Agent prompts are shared via `plugins/air/agents/*.md` — single source of truth.
- Orchestrator logic is now implementation-specific by design (review.md for CLI, review.py for managed) since one is a Claude Code markdown instruction and the other is Python code. No prose duplication between `orchestrator.md` and `review.md` anymore — the managed orchestrator prompt was deleted in v1.7.0.

---

## CLI Orchestrator Research

Subagents cannot nest in Claude Code — only the main session can use the Agent tool. The current architecture (review.md as orchestrator → Agent tool → sub-agents) is the correct pattern. Inconsistency comes from review.md being too long (1276 lines), not from wrong architecture.

**Fix:** Slim review.md to ~300 lines by extracting verbose sections (format rules, wiki learning protocol, resistance levels, author pattern lifecycle) into reference files. Same architecture, less prompt bloat, more consistent execution.

**Agent Teams** (experimental, `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`): alternative with peer-to-peer communication between teammates. Known bug: teammates lack Agent tool (issue #31977). Not production-ready.

**Deferred idea:** CLI triggers Managed Agent (cloud execution from terminal) — would unify execution model but requires internet and can't handle --self mode (local uncommitted changes).

## Roadmap

| Priority | Item | Effort | Impact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Done** | Wiki-backed shared `/air:learn` counter | 0.5 day | Managed reviews now contribute to the learn cadence | `plugins/air/lib/meta.py` owns threshold logic; CLI + managed both bump the same wiki `.air-meta.json` |
| **Future** | Managed per-review wiki writes (Layer 1) | ~3 days | Managed contributes patterns every review instead of only via periodic deep pass | Requires `json-patterns` verifier contract + module expansion (`wiki_learn.py`, `author_patterns.py`, `review_md.py`, `learned_patterns.py`) |
| **Future** | CLI Step 13 sub-steps 2 + 2.5 migration to Python | ~2 days | Deterministic author-pattern lifecycle; saves ~15–20K tokens per CLI review | Depends on the module expansion landing first |
| **Future** | LLM-sanitization helper for disputed findings | ~1 day | Closes CLI/managed asymmetry on ACCEPTED-PATTERNS.md (sub-step 3) | Small Python helper calling Anthropic API; both orchestrators call it |
| **Future** | Inter-diff + respond + self-review logic unification | ~3 days | Shared helpers for non-orchestration logic paths | Modular — can ship one at a time |
| **Future** | GitLab platform support in managed | ~1 week | Managed works on GitLab MRs | Abstract `fetch_pr_*` + `github_repository` resource shape |
| **Done** | Orphan-session cleanup on driver shutdown | 0.5 day | Token savings + cleaner ops | v1.8.0 — atexit + SIGTERM/SIGHUP interrupts tracked session ids |
| **Done** | Auto-detect re-review mode (managed) | 1 day | Cost + feedback loop | v1.8.0 — inter-diff + prior review + dev comments as context |
| **Done** | `--closed` opt-in for closed/merged PRs | 0.5 day | Post-merge audit, pattern backfill | v1.8.0 — state gate + commit-checkout + workflow_dispatch |
| **Done** | Parallel execution for managed reviews | 1 day | 12 min → ~5-8 min | v1.7.0 — client-side asyncio fan-out (Python driver), replaces server-side callable_agents dependency |
| **Blocked** | Server-side parallel sub-agents (callable_agents) | Would simplify review.py | Marginal — client-side fan-out already parallel | Waiting for Research Preview access; `managed/test-parallel.py` detects readiness |
| **Done** | Slim review.md (1319 → 879 lines) | 1 day | CLI consistency | v1.4.0 — extracted --self + --respond |
| **Done** | Respond self-check scaling | 0.5 day | Token savings | v1.4.0 — < 50 lines = fewer agents |
| **Done** | Cross-repo wiki read | 0.5 day | Pattern context | v1.4.0 — reads target wiki, skip write |
| **Done** | Severity calibration bootstrap | 0.5 day | New project UX | v1.4.0 — default thresholds table |
| **Done** | Pure-promotion PR detection | 0.5 day | Workflow | v1.4.0 — warn and offer skip |
| **Done** | Auto-trigger visibility | 0.5 day | Reliability | v1.4.0 — markers + explicit RETURN |
| **Done** | Respond --dry-run | 0.5 day | Preview | v1.4.0 |
| **High** | Reduce orchestrator duplication | 1 day | Maintenance burden | |
| **High** | Further slim review.md (879 → ~300) | 1 day | CLI consistency | Extract verbose sections to reference file |
| **Medium** | GitLab in managed agent | 2-3 days | Platform coverage | |
| **Medium** | Wiki push reliability | 1 day | Sandbox timeout handling | |
| **Low** | Codex in managed agent | 1 day | Second model opinion | |
| **Deferred** | CLI triggers Managed Agent | 1 week | Unified execution model | |
| **Deferred** | Cowork plugin | 1-2 weeks | Non-CLI users | |
| **Deferred** | Slack/Confluence integrations | 1 week | Team visibility | |
| **Deferred** | Agent Teams (experimental) | Research | Alternative parallelism | |

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Bot account over GitHub App | Simpler onboarding — no private key, no JWT, no installation IDs |
| Classic PAT over fine-grained | Fine-grained doesn't support wiki push or GraphQL comments |
| Agents found by name, not stored | Eliminates config files, enables self-bootstrapping |
| Newest agent per name used | Dict overwrite on reversed API list; duplicates are harmless |
| GH_TOKEN in session message | github_repository handles clone; gh CLI needs env var; no API support for session env vars |
| Auto-update on every run | setup.py PATCHes agents with latest prompts; ~2s overhead per run |
| Codex skipped in managed | Requires OpenAI plugin/key in sandbox; optional in CLI too |
| Client-side fan-out for managed reviews (v1.7.0) | callable_agents gated behind Research Preview — Python driver parallelizes via asyncio.gather instead |
| Code blocks in review findings | Improves clarity — both CLI and managed include them |
| Author patterns never deleted | Archived after 10 clean PRs but stay permanently as historical context |
| --self and --respond extracted to separate files | Reduces review.md cognitive load; each mode is self-contained with its own reference to shared steps |
| Respond self-check scales by diff size | < 50 lines = code-reviewer + verifier only; saves ~60% tokens on small fix diffs |
| Cross-repo reads target wiki | Reading patterns from unfamiliar repo is highest value; writing skipped to avoid pollution |
| Bootstrap severity calibration | Default thresholds (security=70, simplify=55, others=60) until project accumulates 10+ data points |
| Author pattern annotations inline in output format | Moved from separate section at end of agent file to where findings are produced — increases compliance from ~60% to expected higher |
